# ClickinBad
Welcome to ClickinBad, Heisenberg.

Click your life away to create the most successful meth empire in the universe. ClickinBad is a fork of the 'Clicking Bad' project - aiming to preserve the game, improve its availability, and update some dated components. The android app was abandoned in favor of making this a web-only project. Game backups can be imported without issue.
